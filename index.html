                    <p>Taramundi is a small village nestled in the mountains of Asturias. It is a place of moss and stone with a population under one thousand.</p>
                    <p>There is one street to enter the main town and it branches off in just two directions. A church sits high on a hill to the left and a row of homes sit at the bottom of a steep climb on the right.</p>
                    <p>Our cottage was a ten minute drive from the center. The road to our abode was partially paved. I was admittedly terrified when we first arrived in the darkness of an autumn’s night.</p>
                    <p>If it was up to this city girl then we would have stopped at Paulina (not Arias)’s Inn and waited until the break of day. Fortunately, I was traveling with much braver and adventurous souls who were luckily from neighborhoods that didn’t have street lights.</p>

                    <p>Granted I don't remember his name, a lovely man was our temporary neighbor but also our landlord, contractor, and host. He had rebuilt both cottages on the property and lived there with his wife. We were fortunate to also meet his daughter, who was visiting at the time.</p>
                    <p>When we arrived he was in the process of renovating a small shed in between the two main residences. Reading and chatting it up on the roof of this unfinished project was such a vibe.</p>
                    <p>The cottage was even cozier than we imagined. The medieval architecture housed an interior that gave traditional Spanish and sleep-away counselors cabin at the same time.</p>
                    <p>We really made outselves at home. Avery brewed us stove top coffee every morning, I made pasta dinners, and Paulina queued up Euphoria on her laptop every night.</p>
                    <p>We read out loud to one another on township terraces. We danced to the sound of cows until we fell on our backs under apple trees. We rested in coves as we watched the moon rise and salty tides fall. Only reality forcing our return to the city from our brief escape.</p>
                    <p>I will always remember, upon that mountain, the experience of solitude and shared values being catalysts for deep friendships.</p>
